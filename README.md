# Vectorized Alpha-Beta Pruning in Reversi

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **vectorized implementation of the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm** using the classic game of **Reversi** as the example. Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique used in minimax decision-making processes, particularly in AI strategies for games like chess, checkers, and, in this case, Reversi. The project compares a strategic Reversi bot with a simpler **Greedy Bot**, showing how intelligent decision-making improves game outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning Optimization**: Speed up decision-making by eliminating unneeded computations.
- **Greedy vs. Strategic Bots**: A comparison of decision-making depth between simple and advanced AI strategies.
- **Iterative Deepening Search**: Find the best move within a time limit, progressively increasing search depth.
- **Cache-Enhanced Performance**: Board states are cached to prevent redundant calculations, improving efficiency.
